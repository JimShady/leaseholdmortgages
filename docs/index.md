The building safety scandal has blighted the lives of tens of thousands of people’s lives in the UK over the last few years, particularly since 2019 when the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) introduced the controversial EWS1 form.

The mortgage lending criteria of banks and building societies on affected properties is very unclear and seems to change regularly, making it hard for owners of leasehold properties to understand whether they are able to re-mortgage or sell their properties. 

> This website (created by me, James, a fellow leaseholder currently stuck in this mess!) attempts to shine a light on these criteria by crowd-sourcing case studies of successful and unsuccesful mortgage applications.

## Barclays

* Adam talked to Barclays in mid August 2022 and they said they haven’t updated/changed any policies lately. They need remedial works completing and then a new EWS1 doing before they will consider lending. However Barclays did allow Adam to change to a buy-to-let mortgage, on the basis of no additional borrowing / equity release and having to pay various extra fees. His building is covered by a developer pledge, although Barclays have never asked for proof of this. Work has not started on his building.
* Jana called Barclays on 16 February 2023 and was informed for her building (under 11m) that Barclays would need an EWS1 form.
* A couple sought to remortgage (new product) a flat covered by a developer pledge with Barclays in Feb 2023. Despite producing the developer’s pledge letter stating necessary works would be covered, the application was declined and returned a zero valuation. The developer now states that their PAS 9980 rates the building at a B1, so no works are required, but this is being challenged by the building [freeholder?] based on a prior assessment, so no EWS1 has been issued. In the meantime, the applicants produced a copy of the Leaseholder Deed of Certificate to Barclays, but the bank continues to insist on the signed Landlord certificate also being issued, contrary to the UKF press release. The freeholder claims to have no responsibility for producing the Landlord Certificate, leaving the couple in a catch 22, unable to provide an EWS1, a letter stating the plan for the remedial works or a landlord certificate.

## Nationwide

* On October 2022 David had confirmation from his freeholder that remediation will start in 14 months, and end 8 months later, and that he will not be liable for any costs. Nationwide however refused his buyer a mortgage.
* * Jana called Nationwide on 16 February 2023 and was informed for her building (under 11m) that Nationwide would need an EWS1 form.

## The Mortgage Works

* As of March 2023 they are still insisting on an EWS1 forms, regardless of freeholder or leaseholder certificates and other documents.
* As of March 2023: Jess applied for a mortgage extension with mortgage works (Nationwide) last year and were refused as we had a failed EWS1 form. We needed the mortgage extension because works are not starting and we can’t sell and at the end of the mortgage term we will have to pay up or lose the flat. We had always intended to sell the property before term end but now we are stuck. We asked them again this year but they want to know when works will start and finish and a new EWS1 form. We cannot give them this as our freeholder is selling up and we have no clue if and when works will start. We so know an application has gone into the BSF but can’t progress until the managing agent supplies more info.

## Halifax

* Lee (writing in March 2023) needed to move, but couldn't sell, so did consent to let on his flat through Halifax. His fixed-rate mortgage has now come to an end but Halifax won't agree a new fix while it's on consent to let (but he also cannot sell it). Due to personal circumstances he can't move back there. So it's now on the 'standard variable' for the last two years.
* John has no EWS1 form, but building is being remediated by freeholder, expected completion summer 2024. As of March 2023 still asking for EWS1 forms though so cannot mortgage with them.
* I am currently with Halifax. Tried to remortgage but they wouldn't convert to buy to let starting they don't do that. B2 rating can't take out a new mortgage either. So the only option they gave me was to extend the number of years I was borrowing for to make it affordable otherwise I couldn't afford the mortgage as interest rates went from 1.7% to 5%

## HSBC

* Lilli spoke to HSBC in late August 2022, and they confirmed their policy still focuses on EWS1 forms. The advisor said that a (passing) EWS1 is required for flats with building safety defects.

## Lloyds

* Lilli talked to Lloyds about the position in late August 2022, they said that they will lending in the following situations: 1. Proof of agreed funding from one of the government schemes (i.e. Building Safety Fund) alongside start and end dates for the work 2. Confirmation from the original developer of the building that they are completing the required remediation . Lilli interprets this as they will lend if you have proof of funding and proof that works are planned.
* Anecdotally there are reports from a broker that flats between 11-18m are not being requested for EWS1 forms now.
* John has no EWS1 form, but building is being remediated by freeholder, expected completion summer 2024. As of March 2023 Lloyds do not seem to be requesting an EWS1 form anymore, but rates for flats are very high, so not an option.

## Natwest

* Lilli wrote to Natwest in August 2022, and they didn’t confirm anything either way. They said “The bank has no contractual relationship with yourself and no responsibility for any material loss you may or may not suffer – be it financial or trouble & strife. I am aware there is a situation in the UK affecting the cladding on possibly thousands of blocks of flats meaning, many people are not in a position to sell their flats and the bank is no way responsible for the blight on their properties.”. How nice.
* I tried to get a new buy to let mortgage from NatWest in October 2022. Provided them with the EWS1 rating which was B2. Also provided them with proof that building has got confirmation regarding funding and with start and end date. They still refused to give a mortgage stating they don't provide mortgages to buildings with a B2 rating.

## Santander

* John has no EWS1 form, but building is being remediated by freeholder, expected completion summer 2024. As of March 2023 do not seem to be requesting EWS1 forms anymore, but have tightened lending rules for flats so more equity required.
* Applied to remortgage in Cardiff with Santander in February 2023. Cladding remission 2/3 complete all covered by Bellway and developer pledge signed. Santander underwriter asked for 4 cladding questions on letterhead paper (cost me £120 and took 3 weeks and 16 emails). Legal officer at Ringley (managing agent) had no idea and was answering incorrectly which in turn would have resulted in the mortgage being denied immediately by Santander. I had to write to the Bellway CEO who responded with correct answers about cladding and Bellway commitment. The Santander nderwriter did then agree to the mortgage, but after nine days no offer had been issued. Santander said it was now with 'the valuers. Valuer asked if the assessments made were in line with PAS9980. We don't know, so have gone back to Belway to ask. However the assessment was done in January 2022 and work started in 2021 so perhaps not?

## Skipton

* Joynul’s 5-year fixed rate came to an end with Santander in 2020, and he tried to re-mortgage with Skipton, but they refused due to him not having an EWS1 form. He’s been on a standard-variable-rate with Santander since. His management company, Tower Hamlets Homes, have said they will do the EWS1 form in early 2023.

## TSB

* Rob tried TSB (via a broker) in August 2022. The building has EWS1 B2 rating, however, the Managing Agent _refuses_ to respond to lender's questions. Explained this situation. After a valuation, credit checks, solicitors being instructed, and months of back-and-forth, TSB asked several times for the EWS1/questions to the Managing Agent which I'd already said I cannot provide. Asked if they would be prepared to lend with a Deed of Certificate. TSB **insisted** on receiving the **signed and executed** deed of certificate. (Rather than simply [reviewing the unsigned deed on the Government's website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mandatory-information-required-from-leaseholders-and-building-owners) and making a decision based on that.) After another few weeks wait, TSB declined with *no explanation given*, despite receiving the completed deed of certificate.
