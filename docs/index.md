The building safety scandal has blighted the lives of tens of thousands of people’s lives in the UK over the last few years, particularly since 2019 when the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) introduced the controversial EWS1 form.

The mortgage lending criteria of banks and building societies on affected properties is very unclear and seems to change regularly, making it hard for owners of leasehold properties to understand whether they are able to re-mortgage or sell their properties. 

> This website (created by me, James, a fellow leaseholder currently stuck in this mess!) attempts to shine a light on these criteria by crowd-sourcing case studies of successful and unsuccesful mortgage applications.

 The content may also be used in meetings between the EOCS team and the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities) as examples of lenders not fulfilling their pledges and promises.

Below you will now find case-studies grouped by lender. **There are currently no case studies from 2023 onwards, when lenders should be more helpful, please send them in if you have one**.

## Barclays

* Adam talked to Barclays in mid August 2022 and they said they haven’t updated/changed any policies lately. They need remedial works completing and then a new EWS1 doing before they will consider lending. However Barclays did allow Adam to change to a buy-to-let mortgage, on the basis of no additional borrowing / equity release and having to pay various extra fees. His building is covered by a developer pledge, although Barclays have never asked for proof of this. Work has not started on his building.

* 'S' called Barclays on 16 February 2023 and was informed for her building (under 11m) that Barclays would need an EWS1 form.

## Nationwide

* In October 2022 David had confirmation from his freeholder that remediation will start in 14 months, and end 8 months later, and that he will not be liable for any costs. Nationwide however refused his buyer a mortgage.

## The Mortgage Works

* As of March 2023 they are still insisting on an EWS1 forms, regardless of freeholder or leaseholder certificates and other documents.
* AS of March 2023: Jess applied for a mortgage extension with mortgage works (Nationwide) last year and were refused as we had a failed EWS1 form. We needed the mortgage extension because works are not starting and we can’t sell and at the end of the mortgage term we will have to pay up or lose the flat. We had always intended to sell the property before term end but now we are stuck. We asked them again this year but they want to know when works will start and finish and a new EWS1 form. We cannot give them this as our freeholder is selling up and we have no clue if and when works will start. We so know an application has gone into the BSF but can’t progress until the managing agent supplies more info.

## Halifax

* Lee (writing in March 2023) needed to move, but couldn't sell, so did consent to let on his flat through Halifax. His fixed-rate mortgage has now come to an end but Halifax won't agree a new fix while it's on consent to let (but he also cannot sell it). Due to personal circumstances he can't move back there. So it's now on the 'standard variable' for the last two years.
* John has no EWS1 form, but building is being remediated by freeholder, expected completion summer 2024. As of March 2023 still asking for EWS1 forms though so cannot mortgage with them.

## HSBC

* Lilli spoke to HSBC in late August 2022, and they confirmed their policy still focuses on EWS1 forms. The advisor said that a (passing) EWS1 is required for flats with building safety defects.

## Lloyds

* Lilli talked to Lloyds about the position in late August 2022, they said that they will lending in the following situations: 1. Proof of agreed funding from one of the government schemes (i.e. Building Safety Fund) alongside start and end dates for the work 2. Confirmation from the original developer of the building that they are completing the required remediation . Lilli interprets this as they will lend if you have proof of funding and proof that works are planned.
* Anecdotally there are reports from a broker that flats between 11-18m are not being requested for EWS1 forms now.
* John has no EWS1 form, but building is being remediated by freeholder, expected completion summer 2024. As of March 2023 Lloyds do not seem to be requesting an EWS1 form anymore, but rates for flats are very high, so not an option

## Natwest

* Lilli wrote to Natwest in August 2022, and they didn’t confirm anything either way. They said “The bank has no contractual relationship with yourself and no responsibility for any material loss you may or may not suffer – be it financial or trouble & strife. I am aware there is a situation in the UK affecting the cladding on possibly thousands of blocks of flats meaning, many people are not in a position to sell their flats and the bank is no way responsible for the blight on their properties.”. How nice.

## Santander

* John has no EWS1 form, but building is being remediated by freeholder, expected completion summer 2024. As of March 2023 do not seem to be requesting EWS1 forms anymore, but have tightened lending rules for flats so more equity required.

## Skipton

* Joynul’s 5-year fixed rate came to an end with Santander in 2020, and he tried to re-mortgage with Skipton, but they refused due to him not having an EWS1 form. He’s been on a standard-variable-rate with Santander since. His management company, Tower Hamlets Homes, have said they will do the EWS1 form in early 2023.
