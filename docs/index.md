The building safety scandal has blighted the lives of tens of thousands of people’s lives in the UK over the last few years, particularly since 2019 when the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) introduced the controversial EWS1 form.

The mortgage lending criteria of banks and building societies on affected properties is very unclear and seems to change regularly, making it hard for owners of leasehold properties to understand whether they are able to re-mortgage or sell their properties. 

This website (created by me, James, a fellow leaseholder currently stuck in this mess!) attempts to shine a light on these criteria by crowd-sourcing case studies of successful and unsuccesful mortgage applications. The content may also be used in meetings between the EOCS team and the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities) as examples of lenders not fulfilling their pledges and promises.

Below you will now find case-studies grouped by lender. **There are currently no case studies from 2023 onwards, when lenders should be more helpful, please send them in if you have one**.

## Barclays

* Adam talked to Barclays in mid August 2022 and they said they haven’t updated/changed any policies lately. They need remedial works completing and then a new EWS1 doing before they will consider lending. However Barclays did allow Adam to change to a buy-to-let mortgage, on the basis of no additional borrowing / equity release and having to pay various extra fees. His building is covered by a developer pledge, although Barclays have never asked for proof of this. Work has not started on his building.

* 'S' called Barclays on 16 February 2023 and was informed for her building (under 11m) that Barclays would need an EWS1 form.

## Nationwide

* In October 2022 David had confirmation from his freeholder that remediation will start in 14 months, and end 8 months later, and that he will not be liable for any costs. Nationwide however refused his buyer a mortgage.

## HSBC

* Lilli spoke to HSBC in late August 2022, and they confirmed their policy still focuses on EWS1 forms. The advisor said that a (passing) EWS1 is required for flats with building safety defects.

## Lloyds

* Lilli talked to Lloyds about the position in late August 2022, they said that they will lending in the following situations: 1. Proof of agreed funding from one of the government schemes (i.e. Building Safety Fund) alongside start and end dates for the work 2. Confirmation from the original developer of the building that they are completing the required remediation . Lilli interprets this as they will lend if you have proof of funding and proof that works are planned.

## Natwest

* Lilli wrote to Natwest in August 2022, and they didn’t confirm anything either way. They said “The bank has no contractual relationship with yourself and no responsibility for any material loss you may or may not suffer – be it financial or trouble & strife. I am aware there is a situation in the UK affecting the cladding on possibly thousands of blocks of flats meaning, many people are not in a position to sell their flats and the bank is no way responsible for the blight on their properties.”. How nice.

## Skipton

* Joynul’s 5-year fixed rate came to an end with Santander in 2020, and he tried to re-mortgage with Skipton, but they refused due to him not having an EWS1 form. He’s been on a standard-variable-rate with Santander since. His management company, Tower Hamlets Homes, have said they will do the EWS1 form in early 2023.
