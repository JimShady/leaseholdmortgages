_Crowd-sourcing lender attitudes to mortgages on leasehold properties with building safety issues_

-------------------------------

The building safety scandal has blighted the lives of tens of thousands of peopleâ€™s lives in the UK over the last few years, particularly since 2019 when the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) introduced the controversial EWS1 form.

The mortgage lending criteria of banks and building societies on affected properties is very unclear and seems to change regularly, making it hard for owners of leasehold properties to understand whether they are able to re-mortgage or sell their properties. 

This website attempts to shine a light on these criteria by crowd-sourcing case studies of successful and unsuccesful mortgage applications. The content may also be used in meetings between the EOCS team and the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities) as examples of lenders not fulfilling their pledges and promises. Therefore please help populate it with your own story! You can contribute in a number of ways (and give as little or as much information as you like):
